[!] WARNING: Some test cases look useless. Consider using a smaller set.
[!] WARNING: You have lots of input files; try starting small.
[+] Here are some useful stats:

    Test case count : 21 favored, 1 variable, 37 total
       Bitmap range : 806 to 8830 bits (average: 1905.51 bits)
        Exec timing : 11.2k to 86.7k us (average: 17.7k us)
